# Contributing to Robot Data Pipeline

We welcome contributions to make robot data conversion more accessible and support more platforms! 

## Quick Start for Contributors

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/robot_data_pipeline.git
   cd robot_data_pipeline
   ```

2. Initialize submodules and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv sync
   ```

3. Run pre-commit checks to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   make format && make lint && make test
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and add tests**
   - Add unit tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run quality checks:**
   ```bash
   make format    # Format code with ruff
   make lint      # Check linting and types with ruff + mypy
   make test      # Run test suite
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message"
   ```
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable

5. **Push and create a Pull Request:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
